              My name is Adams Oyama. I am currently studying WDD 131: Dynamic
              Web Fundamentals. I live in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. I
              have a passion for web development and enjoy creating interactive
              and visually appealing websites. I believe in continuous learning
              and love exploring new technologies and techniques in web design.
              In my free time, I enjoy exploring the cultural heritage and
              natural beauty of Calabar, immersing myself in the rich traditions
              and modern developments of Nigeria. I also stay active in various
              tech communities, continuously enhancing my skills and
              collaborating with like-minded individuals.

              Nigeria, known as the "Giant of Africa," is the most populous
              country on the continent, with over 200 million people. It is a
              diverse nation with more than 250 ethnic groups and a rich
              cultural heritage. From the bustling city of Lagos to the serene
              landscapes of the Niger Delta, Nigeria is a land of contrasts and
              opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nigerians are known for their resilience, creativity, and vibrant
              spirit. The country has a thriving arts scene, with Nollywood
              being one of the largest film industries in the world. Nigerian
              music, particularly Afrobeat, has gained international acclaim.
              The people are also passionate about sports, especially football
              (soccer), and the national team, the Super Eagles, has a large
              following.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nigeria's economy is one of the largest in Africa, driven by oil
              and gas production, agriculture, and a growing tech industry. The
              country is home to many startups and innovation hubs, making it a
              hotspot for tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs.
